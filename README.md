# chatbot

Here is a little chatbot for beginners only.
You can talk with him but he only have a few answers and if you don't trigger some specific words he won't answer you at all.
The AFK is managed with a certain delay.
We have a dot function simulating the writing time of the "bot".

Have Fun !


PS : This project was done as part of the Yes We Web formation.
